# Bird-Pest-Control-System-based-on-WSN
final project about detecting, monitoring, controlling bird pest on rice field with WSN system. communication using Esp8266 that embedded into NodeMCU. sensor for detecting using pir sensor can detecting motion up to 5-6 meter. for repelling  bird pest i use buzzer each node.
this prject should add gsm module for communicationg trough internet, i dont have much time for completing this project so it can monitoring anywhere and anytime.
node 5 work as access point while other node work as station with using mesh topologi. i use mesh topology because when node detecting motion it will send message to all nodes in that area so when nodes received message all buzzer in each nodes will ring so the sound will be heard throughout the area.
